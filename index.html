That thought really affects health. So, don't think too much, if you're tired, take a rest, don't force it. Because there are still people who love and hope that you life will be longer to see happiness in the future
<br><br>
if you feel unhappy with your life, look there is someone who is happy just because you exist, an example is me
<br><br>
May this year be a chapter filled with happiness, success, and love. Thank you for being a part of my life's story. Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with extraordinary joy and achievements! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚</p>
